        <h3 id="travel" class="is-size-3 py-3" style="color: #9A0033">Travel</h3>
        <p class="py-3">You'll be travelling to the depths of rural Northumberland, where it's remote, beautiful and quiet.</p>

        <p class="py-3">Getting all the way to The Peels farm is not easily done via public transport, so we advise you to drive if you have a vehicle. And share lifts where possible. Please use the WhatsApp group for lift sharing options.</p>

        <p class="is-size-2 py-3">🚗 🚙 🚗</p>

        <p class="py-3">If driving isn't an option, then get a train to Berwick upon Tweed which is a 50 minute drive away. We can then pick you up <b>on Friday only, around 1pm</b> for a fare of £10 per person. Please let us know so we can organise in advance. We won't be able to pick people up from the station later in the afternoon (or at any time later in the weekend) because we'll be partying! Alternatively get a taxi from Berwick, but this will be expensive.</p>

        <h3 id="location" class="is-size-3 py-3" style="color: #9A0033">Location</h3>
        <p class="py-3">We will be revelling in the beautiful fields of The Peels farm, in the rolling hills of Northumberland. This is the address of the farm, but bear in mind that <em>the exact location of the festival is about 1/2 a mile from this address</em>. See below for further directions.</p>

        <p><b>The Peels</b></p>
        <p><b>Harbottle</b></p>
        <p><b>Morpeth</b></p>

        </p>

        <p class="py-3">The festival field is about 1/2 a mile from the farm buildings, accessed via a track off the long straight road that leads down to the farm. Turn right by the Corleychella sign, then drive approximately 500m along the track to the field. Please remember to shut the gates behind you.</p>

        <p class="py-3">If you're a member of the <b>Corleychella Plan B</b> WhatsApp group then you're invited! Please let us know if you're able to make it so we know the numbers.</p>
