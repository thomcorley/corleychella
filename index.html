        <p class="py-3">This is a non-profit event, but we need to break even on the costs of the dome, sound system and generator hire, so we're asking for a small contribution of <strong>£35</strong> from each person.</p>
        <p class="py-3">This should cover most of the costs and we'll make up the rest by selling cold beverages at the event at an "honesty bar". Once we've broken even, any remaining drinks will be on the house</p>

        <h3 id="travel" class="is-size-3 py-3" style="color: #9A0033">Travel</h3>
        <p class="py-3">You'll be travelling to the depths of rural Northumberland, where it's remote, beautiful and quiet.</p>

        <p class="py-3">Getting all the way to The Peels farm is not easily done via public transport, so we advise you to drive if you have a vehicle. And share lifts where possible.</p>

        <p class="is-size-2 py-3">🚗 🚙 🚗</p>

        <p class="py-3">If driving isn't an option, then get a train to Berwick upon Tweed which is a 50 minute drive away. We can then pick you up for a fare of £10 per person. Alternatively get a taxi from Berwick, but this will be very expensive!</p>

        <p class="py-3">Please use the WhatsApp group for lift sharing options. If you need picked up from the train station, aim to arrive in Berwick for 1pm on Friday. And please let us know so we can organise in advance. We won't be able to pick people up from the station later in the afternoon because we'll be partying!</p>

        <p class="is-size-2 py-3">🕺</p>
