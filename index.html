        <p class="py-3">We will be revelling in the beautiful fields of The Peels farm, in the rolling hills of Northumberland:</p>
        <p><strong>The Peels</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Harbottle</strong></p>

        <h3 id="travel" class="is-size-3 py-3" style="color: #9A0033">Travel</h3>
        <p class="py-3">You'll be travelling to the depths of rural Northumberland, where it's remote, beautiful and quiet.</p>

        <p class="py-3">Getting all the way to The Peels farm is not easily done via public transport, so we advise you to drive if you have a vehicle. And share lifts where possible.</p>

        <p class="is-size-2 py-3">🚗 🚙 🚗</p>

        <p class="py-3">If driving isn't an option, then get a train to Berwick upon Tweed which is a 50 minute drive away. We can then pick you up for a fare of £10 per person. Alternatively get a taxi from Berwick, but this will be expensive.</p>

        <p class="py-3">Please use the WhatsApp group for lift sharing options. If you need picked up from the train station, aim to arrive in Berwick for 1pm on Friday. And please let us know so we can organise in advance. We won't be able to pick people up from the station later in the afternoon (or at any time later in the weekend) because we'll be partying!</p>

        <p class="is-size-2 py-3">🕺</p>

        <h3 id="travel" class="is-size-3 py-3" style="color: #9A0033">Covid Restrictions</h3>

        <p class="py-3">One of the requirements from our parents that this event can go ahead on their farm is that it must be legal from a Covid point of view. This means we are allowed a maximum of <b>30</b> people.</p>

        <p class="py-3">If you're a member of the <b>Corleychella Plan B</b> WhatsApp group then you're invited! Please let us know if you're able to make it so we know the numbers.</p>
